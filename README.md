-----

This is a cookie cutter project. It's intention is to serve as a base structure to get you started scaffolding new projects. Either use it as a template from the Github UI, or clone it and whack the `.git` directory.

After getting your project up from this template, run the [prepare.sh](./prepare.sh) script to rename the package to whatever you want to call your new project.

```text
‚ùØ ./prepare.sh newproject
done
  pip install -e .
```
